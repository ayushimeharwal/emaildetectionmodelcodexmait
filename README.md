team name- codeX mait,
team leader name- Gautam Jain,
track- We have build our app using two machine learning algorithms naive based classifier, support vector mechanism. ,
idea- our model basicall detects whether a email is spam or ham. it can be very usefull so we can become self reliant (atma nirbhar) if we improve this app and add authentication which can directly view the emails without adding it. ,
to start local host first run model.py file then run app.py file after that open your terminal and write "streamlite run app.py".
